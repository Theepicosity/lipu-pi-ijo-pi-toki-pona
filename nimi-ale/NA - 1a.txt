[1] This usage of this word is hard to analyize. Jan Pije's website lists this as a particle, but it is generally treated as a preposition. And, though this isn't present in ma pona pi toki pona, certain dialects use it as a content word which modifies prepositionally. This is the basis behind the phrase "semi-prepositional semi-content word."
[2] The definite-indefinite distinction doesn't have to exist, as it is not a widely accepted analysis.
