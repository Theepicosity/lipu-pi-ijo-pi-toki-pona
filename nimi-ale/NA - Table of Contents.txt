PARTS OF SPEECH
kala Salan te:
particle: words performing purely grammatical functions.
content word: words performing purely semantic functions (no overlap between particles and content words). 
semi-preposition: specific group of content words that can perform several preposition, relational, and co-verb esque functions. 
preverb: specific group of content words that can modify verb phrases in the opposite direction (head final) of typical modifier order. 
semi-conjunction: taso; anu. specific group of content words (varying on analysis) that can perform conjunction roles or semantic roles depending on context. 
modifier particle: a; kin. group of words acting like particles without semantic meaning, but providing information on emphasis and emotion. (semantic possibility varies by speaker)
interjection: words or clusters able to be said in isolation as an exclamation or remark. pona! suwi! lape pona. etc.
loaned adjective: loaned words that can act strictly as modifiers on native TP content words to name said concept in context. ex. ma Sonko
