preverb: specific group of content words that can modify verb phrases in the opposite direction (head final) of typical modifier order. 
semi-conjunction: taso; anu. specific group of content words (varying on analysis) that can perform conjunction roles or semantic roles depending on context. 
modifier particle: a; kin. group of words acting like particles without semantic meaning, but providing information on emphasis and emotion. (semantic possibility varies by speaker)
interjection: words or clusters able to be said in isolation as an exclamation or remark. pona! suwi! lape pona. etc.
