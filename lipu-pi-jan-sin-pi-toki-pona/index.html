		<h1>Beginner's Resource of Toki Pona</h1>
		<h2><i>by kule epiku Atawan</i></h2>
		<br/><sijelo><s1>
		toki! My name is kule epiku Atawan, and this is my resource for Toki Pona! Despite the name, this resource is meant to help people on any scale of toki pona. If you are a beginner who wants to learn the words, or an experienced speaker who may have just forgotten a definition, this document can help!
		<br/><br/>
		To the left, you will see a list of links to help you learn or practice toki pona. Out of all of the links, I most certainly recommend checking out the toki pona Discord Server, <a href="https://discord.gg/Byqn5z9"><i>ma pona pi toki pona.</i></a> There are many people on there who are able to answer any questions you have about toki pona. Additionally, voice chats where we speak toki pona are very frequent, so you can always stop in to listen or even try talking!
		<br/><br/> <!-- add glyphs at some point in the future !-->
		Below is a list of words commonly used in toki pona, their definitions, some examples, and some other cool facts about each word. Please note that various sources list different words. Some of these words are <i>non-pu,</i> meaning that they don't show up in the book written by the creator of the language, Sonja Lang. This may be because it comes before the book and wasn't featured in it, or it comes after the book and was made by the toki pona community. This one shows a few more than lipu pu- basically, all of the common ones that you may want to use. There are more obscure words which don't come up as often; if you encounter a word that you haven't seen before, it may be in either <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t-pjAgZDyKPXcCRnEdATFQOxGbQFMjZm-8EvXiQd2Po/edit">nimi ale pona</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1odOeRhe7-I2g25OmeyazW5uAD56m5Po7">nimi ale</a>.

		<h3><a id="a">a</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Everything else is just as complex.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: (emphasis, emotion or confirmation)
		<br/>Part of Speech: adjective
		<br/>Etymology: Onomatopoeia.
		<br/>Example: ni li suli mute <b>a</b>! (This is very, <b>very</b> big!)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>a doesn't really mean anything precise. It simply adds emphasis to your conversation, like a cherry on top of your word sundae. For example, "ona li ike a" still means "It is bad," but it's <i>particularly</i> bad. The "a" in this sentence conveys more emotion than simply saying "ona li ike." In this way, "a" sort of acts like an exclamation point.
		<br/><li>A common response to, well, anything in toki pona is simply responding with "a." It can be used to show your acknowledgement of something.
		<br/><li>Keep in mind that a is still a modifier, and only a modifier. "a" doesn't really mean anything on its own.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="akesi">akesi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>The golden idol of toki pona.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: non-cute animal; reptile, amphibian
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "hagedis," meaning "lizard."
		<br/>Example: <b>akesi</b> suli li lon tenpo pini. (Big <b>reptiles</b> were present in the past.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>Note that, although akesi can mean both a non-cute animal <i>and</i> a lizard, it doens't imply that those are the same. You can have an "akesi suwi" (cute lizard) as much as an other animal.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ala">ala</a></h3>
		<i><fl>[This flavor text left intentionally blank.]</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: no, not, zero
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Georgian "არა," or "ara," meaning "no."
		<br/>Examples: mi sona <b>ala</b> e nasin pi toki ni. (I <b>don't</b> know how to speak this language.) sina sona <b>ala</b> sona? (Do you know?)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>Aside from simply adding a negator to any word it modifies, ala is also how questions are commly formed in toki pona. Putting "x ala x" is pretty much just asking "x, or not x?" For example, "sina pona ala pona?" does mean "Are you good?" but it more literally means "Are you good or not good?"
		<br/><li>Be careful when using ala. A common mistake for beginners is to say "mi sona e toki pona ala," but unless you are trying to say "I know not toki pona," then you should say "mi sona ala e toki pona." In the second sentence, the "ala" modifies the verb, changing it to "don't know," while in the first, the "ala" modifies the noun, changing it to "not toki pona."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="alasa">alasa</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Reminder that toki pona is based on hunter-gatherer values.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to hunt, forage
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preverb
		<br/>Etymology: From Acadian French "à la chasse," meaning "hunting," from French "chasser," which means "to hunt."
		<br/>Example: jan ante li <b>alasa</b> e kili lili. (Other people <b>forage</b> for the small fruit.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>In casual conversation, alasa is used simply for "find." For example, "mi wile alasa e supa monsi ante" means "I want to find another chair."
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>Some people use alasa as a preverb, that is, a word that comes before a verb to change it's meaning. Preverb alasa means "try," as in, "mi alasa sona e sina," meaning "I try to understand you." This is opposed to the other word which means try, <a href="#kepeken">lukin</a>. Another fun idea is that alasa can mean actions with no definite end, whereas lukin refer to actions which can end.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ale">ale</a></h3>
		<i><fl>ale li pona.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: all; abundant, countless, bountiful, every, plentiful; abundance, everything, life, universe; one hundred
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "alle," meaning "all."
		<br/>Example: jan <b>ale</b> li ike. taso mi ike ala. (<b>Every</b>one is bad except for me.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>When talking about numbers in toki pona, ale can mean 100. For example, "ale mute mute luka tu wan" means 100+20+20+5+2+1, or 148.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>ale has a synonym, <i>ali</i>, to make it distinct from ala. Unlike other words which are claimed to be synonyms, these are exactly the same, and are used interchangably.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="anpa">anpa</a></h3>
		<i><fl>The universal word for "land above."</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: bowing down, downward, humble, lowly, dependent
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, positional noun
		<br/>Etymology: From Acadian French "en bas," meaning "below."
		<br/>Example: mi kepeken e nasin <b>anpa</b>. (I take the <b>downward</b> road.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>anpa is a relative positional noun, meaning that it refers to a position relative to the subject. For example, "ona li lon anpa pi supa lape" means "It is underneath my bed." This is one of the weaker examples of a positional noun though, as it means a lot more than just "downwards."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ante">ante</a></h3>
		<i><fl>And kule ante is magenta.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: different, altered, changed, other
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preposition (unconventional)
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "ander," meaning "other," or "different."
		<br/>Example: ona li <b>ante</b> e nasin pi musi ni. (They <b>changed</b> the rules of the game.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>When using this word, take into consideration that it does not mean "opposite." It only means different, so a "pimeja ante" doesn't mean white, it only means a different shade of black.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>ante can be used in many phrases. Some cool examples include: "jan ante" which means "other people," and "toki ante" which means "different speech." Putting this phrase into the verb spot gives us the word "translate."
		<br/><li>Another neat phrase is "ante la," which means "differently." This is often used to change the topic of a conversation, as in "mi sona e ni. ante la, sina sona ala sona e musi Tewawija?" which means "I know this. Changing the subject, do you know the game Terraria?"
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="anu">anu</a></h3>
		<i><fl>sina anu anu anun't e nimi?</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: or
		<br/>Part of Speech: particle, conjunction
		<br/>Etymology: From Georgian "ან," or "an," meaning "or."
		<br/>Example: sina ken pali <b>anu</b> musi; seme li pona tawa sina? (You can work <b>or</b> play; which one do you think is good?)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>A common phrase in toki pona is "anu seme," which means "or what." It's often stapled onto the end of sentences to turn them into questions, for example, "sina ken toki, anu seme?" means "Can you talk?" but it more literally means "Can you talk, or what?" This isn't to say that it has the same laid-back English connontation... but it is used in the same way.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>anu is rarely used as a content word, meaning to choose, or decide. For example, "o anu e leko" is telling someone to decide on a block.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="apeja">apeja</a></h3>
		<i><fl>APEJA LI MI, APEJA LI MI</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: shame, guilt
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "häpeä," meaning "shame."
		<br/>Example: mi pilin <b>apeja</b> lili tan ijo pi lukin sina. (I'm feeling a bit <b>guilty</b> because of what you saw.)
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="awen">awen</a></h3>
		<i><fl>o awen pona, lon weka sina.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: enduring, kept, protected, safe, waiting, staying; to continue to
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preverb
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "houden," meaning "keep, care for, hold. (in a particular state)"
		<br/>Examples: ona li moli ala la ona li <b>awen</b>. (If it's not dead, it <b>continues</b>.) taso, pilin mi la ona li <b>awen</b> pakala. (However, I think it will <b>continue</b> to break.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>awen can be used as a preverb, meaning that it can go before the verb to modify it. An example of this would be "ona li awen pona," which means "It continues to be good."
		<br/><li>A common thing to say in toki pona before the beginning of a sentence is "awen la," which means "continually." An example would be "awen la ona li pipi e mi," which means "She continually anoys me." The distinction between "awen la" and awen preverb is subtle, but noticeable.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="e">e</a></h3>
		<i><fl>It's the one particle everyone seems to forget.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: (before the direct object)
		<br/>Part of Speech: particle
		<br/>Etymology: A priori.
		<br/>Example: mi pana <b>e</b> telo tawa sina. (I give water to you.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>Always remember to use e. A common beginners mistake is to omit e, like in the sentence "mi kama sona e toki pona," which is sometimes incorrectly said as "mi kama sona toki pona." It does sound more similar to English, but remember that it's not correct.
		<br/><li>e goes before the direct object, so it's the thing your doing the action on. This causes some quirks that you must be aware of; for example, "mi toki e sina" doesn't mean "I'm talking to you," but it means "I'm talking you."
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>There is a really strange analysis that e is actually a preposition, meaning "affect" or "directed at." Syntactically, e is the same as a preposition, but it doesn't have a content word meaning. For the first actual preposition, see <a href="#kepeken">kepeken</a>.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="en">en</a></h3>
		<i><fl>And another particle which just straight up isn't used.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: (between multiple subjects)
		<br/>Part of Speech: particle
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "en," meaning "and."
		<br/>Example: jan Jepo <b>en</b> jan Tenli li pali e lipu sin. (Jepo <b>and</b> Tenli are making a new book.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>A common English word that en is compared to is "and," which can be useful as a demonstration but isn't really how en works. English "and" is much more versatile than en is; for example, in English you can say "I ignored and blocked her," but you cannot say "mi weka en pake e ona." Instead, you would say "mi weka li pake e ona." en can only be used to connect subjects; other words connect verbs and objects, specifically li and e respectively.
		<br/><li>Multiple subjects with the word en are considered "connected," in that they share the same verb. An example of this is "mi en sina li pana e leko tu." This sentence means "Me and you give two blocks," but not two blocks <i>each</i>.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>en is sometimes used in the phrase "en la" to mean "and." This definitely isn't how you're supposed to use it, because en isn't a content word and thus has no meaning, but it's still fun.
		<br/><li>en is also sometimes used to like items in prepositional phrases together. For example, "mi pana e ni tawa jan Jepo en jan Tenli." In this case, I am giving something to both Jepo and Tenli.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="esun">esun</a></h3>
		<i><fl>In my opinion, this is one of the weeker words.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: market, shop, fair, bazaar, business transaction
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: Of Akan origin.
		<br/>Example: mi tawa <b>esun</b>. (I go to the <b>store</b>.)
		<br/></ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>One of the most common uses of esun (probably more common than what it's actually used for) is the phrase "tenpo esun," meaning "week." This is because most business operations are week-based, and so one could say that a unit of "business time" is a week. Yes, I know, it's a tenuous claim.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ijo">ijo</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Its most common usage is in example sentences.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: thing, phenomenon, object, matter
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Esperanto "io," meaning "something," which is from Romance "i-," which is the root of relative pronouns.
		<br/>Example: <b>ijo</b> ni li kama sewi. (This <b>thing</b> is rising.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>ijo may sometimes be used to mean "situation." "ijo ni li ike" may mean "This is a bad situation."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ike">ike</a></h3>
		<i><fl>ike pike sike sike.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: bad, negative; non-essential, irrelevant
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "ilkeä," meaning "mean," or "wicked."
		<br/>Example: sina pakala e supa sike? ni li <b>ike</b> a! (You broke a table? That's <b>terrible</b>!)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>There are plenty of words in toki pona (arguably, all of them) which can be used as interjections, single word sentences. ike is one of the most common examples of this; if someone told you that they had to do schoolwork all day and haven't had a break, an appropriate response would be "ike!"
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ilo">ilo</a></h3>
		<i><fl>ilo nanpa li ken <s>ilo</s>weka e nanpa!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: tool, implement, machine, device
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Esperanto "ilo," meaning "tool."
		<br/>Example: mi pali e tomo kepeken <b>ilo</b>. (I made a house with a <b>tool</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>The transitive verb from of ilo is "to make into a tool," which has the same meaning as the word kepeken. So, at least in the verb case, you could say that kepeken and ilo are synonyms.
		<br/><li>The phrase "tenpo ilo," which may or may not also be used more than the actual meaning of the word, is generally interpreted to mean either "minutes" or "hours," the idea being that minutes and hours can be used as a tool for telling the time.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="insa">insa</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Whenever a word sounds kinda like English, assume it has Tok Pisin etymology.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: centre, content, inside, between; internal organ, stomach
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, positional noun
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "insait," meaning "inside."
		<br/>Example: moku ni li pakala e <b>insa</b> mi. (This food hurts my <b>stomach</b>.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>insa is a relative positional noun, so you can use it to describe positions relative to you. For example, "ona li lon insa pi supa lape" is "It is inside my bed." All positional nouns follow this pattern; each one can mean a position, as well as a part of the body, in this case, the stomach.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<!-- hmmmmm ken la mi o weka e ni
		<h3><a id="isipin">isipin</a></h3>
		<i><fl>It's fair to be skeptical about this word.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to think, to imagine, to believe
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Tagalog "isipin," meaning "to think."
		<br/>Example: mi <b>isipin</b> e sina la olin mi li kama suli. (When I <b>think</b> about you, my love grows stronger.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>isipin is one of the harder words to get a hold of. A good translation of isipin is the English word <i>muse</i>. It is different from "sona," in that what you are thinking about isn't always factual, and it's different from "pilin," in that what you are thinking isn't always emotional.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge
		<br/><ul><li>isipin can be used to create all sorts of fun words, like "isipin ken," which means guess, "isipin ike," which means skepticality, "isipin sin," which means idea, "isipin kon," which means "dream," or "isipin awen," which means "something that you can't stop thinking about."
		<br/><li>isipin is one of the newest words to be generally recognized; only coming into creation in August of 2020. Unlike most other generally accepted new words, this word was only made by one person, who goes by "ko." This method of creating new words has gone under heavy criticism; so much so that people will hate me for saying that isipin is "generally accepted."
		</ul><br/>

		<h3><a id="jaki">jaki</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Not an accurate description of yakisoba.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: disgusting, obscene, sickly, toxic, unclean, unsanitary
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From English "yucky."
		<br/>Example: tomo ni li <b>jaki</b>. (This house is <b>gross</b>.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>You can also say "jaki ala" to mean clean. This is most commonly used as a verb: "mi jaki ala e sijelo mi" means "I clean my body."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="jan">jan</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Cut out the middlejan.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: human being, person, somebody
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Cantonese "人," or "jan," meaning "person."
		<br/>Example: <b>jan</b> ale li sona e ma ni. (Every <b>person</b> knows about this place.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>When saying names in toki pona, it's important that the name has to describe something. The most common thing for it to describe is a jan, because most people tend to be humans. For this reason, the word "jan" may be shortened to just the letter "j" when talking about someone's name. For example, "jan Tenli" may be shortened to "jTenli."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="jasima">jasima</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Usually pronounced "jasima." <jasima1>"jasima."</jasima1> <jasima2>"jasima."</jasima2> <jasima3>"jasima."</jasima3> <jasima4>"kulijo!"</jasima4></fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: reflect, resound, mirror, be on the opposite/polar end of
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preposition (unconventional)
		<br/>Etymology: From Turkish "yansıtmak," meaning "to reflect," or "to reverberate."
		<br/>Example: tenpo mi li tenpo <b>jasima</b> sina. (My time is the <b>opposite</b> of your time.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>jasima is a post-pu word- one of the most common, in fact. It was of a few created by a committee of people on the <i>ma pona pi toki pona</i> Discord server.
		<br/><li>jasima often means just a few things which aren't quite related to what it actually means. jasima is often used to mean "echo," which is a valid interpretation, but it's also used to mean "livestream," or "record," as in, "sina ken ala ken jasima e sinpin sina?" which means "can you stream your screen?" The idea comes from the fact that the streamed recording is a reflection of the original, but it's not quite the same meaning as jasima proper.
		<br/><li>jasima is sometimes used as a preposition, though this usage is not very popular. If you want to see the first word that is <i>actually</i> a preposition, see <a href="#kepeken">kepeken</a>.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="jelo">jelo</a></h3>
		<i><fl>palisa jelo li kili nanpa wan!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: yellow, yellowish
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From English "yellow."
		<br/>Example: palisa <b>jelo</b> ni li moku pona. (This <b>yellow</b> stick is good food.)
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="jo">jo</a></h3>
		<i><fl>The opposite of jon't is jo-positive.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to have, carry, contain, hold
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Mandarin "有," or "yǒu," meaning "have."
		<br/>Example: mi <b>jo</b> e lipu pi sitelen tawa. (I'm <b>carrying</b> a book about movies.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>There is a faction of people known as <i>jon'ters</i> who insist that jo is an uneccessary word. The argument here is that jo can be replaced by other words, specifically either poki or luka. So, while a normal person would say, "mi jo e supa monsi ni" to mean "I am carrying this chair," a jon'ter would say, "mi luka e supa monsi ni," meaning "This chair is in my hand."
		<br/><li>A common usage of the word jo is "metaphorical jo," which is when you use the word jo with something that isn't really an object. An example of this is "lawa mi li jo e sona lili," which means "My brain carries little information."
		<br/><li>A much less common usage of the word jo is "relational jo," where jo specifies a vague relationship between two words. An example would be "nasin ni li jo e jan lawa" which would mean "This road has a caretaker." In this case, the word jo acts much more like the English word <i>have</i>.

		<h3><a id="kala">kala</a></h3>
		<i><fl>jan mute li kala! penguins li kala.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: fish, marine animal, sea creature
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "kala," meaning "fish."
		<br/>Example: mi wile lanpan e seli tan <b>kala</b> sewi. (I must steal fire from the <b>fish</b> gods.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>kala can mean any sort of animal that goes into water. This includes obvious ones, like fish, to whales and dolphins, but any water animal can be a kala. Penguins are sometimes called kala because they spend lots of time in water.

		<h3><a id="kalama">kalama</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kalama seli li SKHKSHKSHKSKH</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to produce a sound; recite, utter aloud
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Serbo-Croatian "galama," meaning "fuss," or "noise."
		<br/>Example: <b>kalama</b> mute li lon. (There's lots of <b>noise</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>A common usage of kalama is the phrase "kalama musi," which means music. kalama doesn't <i>just</i> mean music though; it means any sound. Because it is a general sound, it has a lot of overlap with other words. toki is just "kalama jan," and mu is just "kalama soweli."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kama">kama</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kala (li) kama kamalawala ala la kala (li) kama lawa tawa ma kala (li) ken kalama tawa kala lawa.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: arriving, coming, future, summoned; to become, manage to, succeed in
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preverb
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "kamap," meaning "arrive," or "happen."
		<br/>Examples: <b>kama</b> pi jan suli li suli tawa kulupu ni. (The <b>arrival</b> of the ambassador is important to this town.) mi <b>kama</b> pali e ni (I <b>manage</b> to do this.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>The main usage of kama is as a preverb. Despite being the primary definition, it doesn't translate well into English; you can think of it as "coming," as in, "mi kama lape" means "I am coming to sleep," but even that doesn't portray the word very well.
		<br/><li>A very common usage of kama is "tenpo kama" which means "the future."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kapesi">kapesi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>ona li moli kapesi.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: brown, gray
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Greek "καφές," or "kafés," meaning "light brown."
		<br/>Example: sike ni li <b>kapesi</b>. (This circle is <b>brown</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>kapesi is a pre-pu word, and probably the least used one on this list. Color words are typically considered irrelevant anyways, so if you don't want to use non-pu words, you can say "kule ma" to mean earth color.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kasi">kasi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kasi ike mute li lon ma ni! kasi ike li lon!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: plant, vegetation; herb, leaf
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "kasvi," meaning "plant."
		<br/>Example: mi sona ala e <b>kasi</b> pi loje laso. (I don't know of a purple <b>plant</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>The definition of most things in toki pona is not strictly scientific, and this word is a good example. "kasi" can refer to plants, but can also refer to things that aren't typically considered plants, like lichen or algae or coral.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ken">ken</a></h3>
		<i><fl>In the context of possibility...</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to be able to, be allowed to, can, may; possible
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preverb
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "ken," meaning "can."
		<br/>Examples: sina <b>ken</b> pali e kalama musi sin. (You <b>could</b> make a new song.) <b>ken</b> pi kama mi li lili. (The <b>possibility</b> of my arrival is slim.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>ken as a preverb means that something is possible, but this can mean much more than the English word "can." It could mean "can," or it could mean "may," or "able to." One thing that it may not mean, though, is "must." ken generally leans towards things that have a <i>possibility</i> of being done, but don't have to. If you want a word that implies things <i>need</i> to be done, see wile.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>The interpretation that the noun form of ken is possibility is very rarely used, though it does appear in the most common phrase using ken, "ken la," which means "in the context of possibility," or put more simply, "maybe." Some people don't like this interpretation though, and insist that "ken la" isn't a good translation of "maybe."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kepeken">kepeken</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Either the prettiest word or the ugliest word, but either way we can all agree that it's too long.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to use, with, by means of
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preposition
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "gebruiken," meaning "to use."
		<br/>Examples: ona li pali e lupa suli <b>kepeken</b> luka ona taso. (He made a giant hole <b>using</b> only his hands.) mi wile <b>kepeken</b> e ilo ni. (I need to <b>use</b> this tool.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>kepeken is a preposition. (The first one on this list!) This means that you can use it after the direct object to specify an indirect object. For example, if you wanted to say "I make a house with a hammer," you could say "mi pali e tomo," but the hammer would disappear! To solve this problem, you can use a preposition to specify the inderect object, so in this case you could say "mi pali e tomo <i>kepeken</i> ilo."
		<br/><li>Be careful when using prepositions. There is not a particle to determine where a prepositional phrase starts, so you must pay attention and use the context of the sentence to find it.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>Usually, when you use prepositions without a direct object you omit the word "e," because if you include it, the meaning of the sentence may change. However, kepeken is an interesting case. "mi kepeken e ni" has effectively the same meaning as "mi kepeken ni," except for the fact that some people hate it. Use whichever interpretation you want.

		<h3><a id="kili">kili</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kili lili li lili kili</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: fruit, vegetable, mushroom
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Georgian "ხილი," or "xili," meaning "fruit."
		<br/>Example: mi moku e <b>kili</b> loje. (We are eating a red <b>fruit</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>kili can mean pretty much any edible plant part that isn't pan. Many things can be kili if you can eat them, for example, <i>cacti</i>. In fact, it's not even limited to plants, as muchrooms can be kili too, though some people insist on making a new word for all fungi, called "soko."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kin">kin</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Somewhere in between "has a meaning" and "doesn't have a meaning."</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: too, also, as well
		<br/>Part of Speech: adjective
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "-kin," meaning "too," or "also."
		<br/>Example: sina kute e kalama musi ni? mi kute e ona <b>kin</b>! (You've heard this song? I've heard it <b>too</b>!)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>In lipu pu, "kin" is treated as a complete synonym of <a href="a">a,</a> but in modern usage this isnt really true. kin still means emphasis, just a specific type that says "me too!" Some circles of toki pona may continue to use kin in the same way as a, so be aware of this when using this word.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>A cool phrase to use is "kin la," which means "also." This often relates back to the previous sentence, as in "jan mute li lon. kin la, jan mute li toki ala," which means "Many people are here. Also, many people aren't talking."
		<br/><li>Most of the time, kin is strapped onto the end of a sentence, but sometimes it's used like a regular modifier. You can say "mi pali e ni kin" to mean "I'm doing this too," but if you want to, you can say "mi kin li pali e ni" to mean "I, too, am doing this."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kipisi">kipisi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>TEN WORDS THEY DON'T TEACH YOU IN PU!!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: split, cut, slice
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Iñupiat "kipriruk," meaning "cut," or from Swahili "kipisi," meaning "sliver."
		<br/>Example: ona li <b>kipisi</b> e pan. (He <b>sliced</b> the bread.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>kipisi means a similar, though not quite exact, thing to the word tu. Both can mean "to make into two," but while "mi tu e ijo ni" means "I make this thing into two," "mi kipisi e ijo ni" specifically means "I cut this thing into two parts," which implies that the two things created from the action are <i>parts</i> of the whole.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kiwen">kiwen</a></h3>
		<i><fl>In some, admittedly bad, dialects, this means -1.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: hard object, metal, rock, stone
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "kiven," meaning "stone."
		<br/>Example: mi pana e <b>kiwen</b> tawa telo. (I threw the <b>stone</b> into the water.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>kiwen as a modifier means "hard," but it can really represent any attribute that a stone has. In some cases, it can mean a similar thing to the word awen, in that it can be used to mean "tough," or "enduring."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ko">ko</a></h3>
		<i><fl>jan ko's jan's ko's jan ko.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: clay, clinging form, dough, semi-solid, paste, powder
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Cantonese "膏," or "gou," meaning "cream."
		<br/>Example: <b>ko</b> mute li lon ma ni. (There is lots of <b>mud</b> in this area.)
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kon">kon</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kon kon = secret agent breath</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: air, breath; essence, spirit; hidden reality, unseen agent
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Mandarin "空氣," or "kōngqì," meaning "air."
		<br/>Example: <b>kon</b> pi nimi ni li seme? (What's the <b>spirit</b> of this word?)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>kon can mean many things, and is useful as both an adjective and a noun. "kon wawa" is wind, "len kon" is a cloak, "jan kon" is a spy, "kon nimi" is a definition, "monsuta kon" is a ghost, and "kon jan" is a person's soul. Just to name a few.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kule">kule</a></h3>
		<i><fl>hey, mi kule!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: colourful, pigmented, painted
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Acadian French "couleur," meaning "color."
		<br/>Example: <b>kule</b> pi sitelen ni li ante tawa sitelen ante. (The <b>colors</b> of this picture are different to other pictures.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>While there are words for individual colors in toki pona, if you wish to you can describe any color as kule. Examples include: "kule suno" for yellow, "kule telo" for blue, "kule kasi" for green, "kule seli" for orange, "kule sewi" for blue/white, "kule jaki" for brown, and plenty of others.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>kule can also refer to the LGBTQ+ community, because the community is described as "colorful," potentially in reference to the pride flag.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kulupu">kulupu</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kulupu li jan mute.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: community, company, group, nation, society, tribe
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Tongan "kulupu," meaning "group."
		<br/>Example: mi weka tan <b>kulupu</b> ike. (I left the bad <b>group</b>.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>It may be worth pointing out that kulupu doesn't have to mean only people, as most people can parse a "kulupu ijo" as being a group of objects.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kute">kute</a></h3>
		<i><fl>"have I been muted this whole time? oh that's neat."</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: ear; to hear, listen; pay attention to, obey
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Acadian French "écouter," meaning "listen."
		<br/>Example: mi pini e kalama musi mi! sina wile ala wile <b>kute</b>? (I finished my song! Do you want to <b>listen</b>?)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>The "obey" definition of kute is VERY rarely used. Often, people use lawa to mean "control," and flip the entire sentence around. Though, on the flipside, "o kute" is probably one of the <i>most</i> common usages of kute, and it means "pay attention."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="la">la</a></h3>
		<i><fl>The word I have been dreading having to explain.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: (between the context phrase and the main phrase)
		<br/>Part of Speech: particle, conjunction
		<br/>Etymology: From Acadian French "-la," which is a proximal and topical suffix.
		<br/>Examples: mi pini e pali mi <b>la</b> mi ken musi. (When I finish my work, I can play.) tenpo pini <b>la</b> mi kama sona e nimi ale. (I've learned all of the words.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>This word is probably the hardest word to describe in toki pona, as it's a concept that English really lacks. la separates the context phrase from the main phrase. The way I usually translate it is "with this as context," which sounds weird, but actually helps. An example may be: "jan Tenli li sona e nimi la jan Tepo li sona kin." Using this translation, the sentence becomes "Tenli knows the word. With this as context, Tepo also knows it." This may seem like a very weird and useless sentence, until you rearrange it and see that it means "When Tenli knows the word, Tepo also knows it."
		<br/><br/><li>la can be used for all sorts of cool things; one common usage is to form conditionals. For example, "mi pali e ni la ijo pona li kama" means "If I make this, good things will come." In this case, the la translates into the word "if."
		<br/><li>Another common usage of la is with time. "tenpo kama la" means "in the context of the coming time," which translates into English as "in the future." You can also say "tenpo pini la" for "the finished time," or "tenpo lon la"/"tenpo ni la" to mean "right now." In this way, la can be used as a tense marker.
		<br/><li>And, lastly, single words can be used as adverbs. "awen la" means continually, "ken la" means maybe, and "tan la" means originally. There are also some other cool constructions, like "mi la," which means "in my opinion." la really is a cool word!
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>A comma may or may not go after the word la, depending on the context. A comma isn't <i>required,</i> but it can be there, and when speaking toki pona it's one of the few parts where speakers include a pause.
		<br/><li>In a way, the word la really is an embodiment of the language. toki pona is generally very context sensitive, and la helps to define the context in which you are speaking.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="lanpan">lanpan</a></h3>
		<i><fl>What is this lanpannery?</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: take, seize, catch, receive, get
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preverb (unconventional)
		<br/>Etymology: From Greek "λαμβάνω," or "lamváno," meaning "take."
		<br/>Example: mi <b>lanpan</b> e leko tan jan ante. (I <b>took</b> a block from someone else.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>Some people really, REALLY hate this word. This is partially because it is a word created by a bunch of people after lipu pu was released, but also because some people think that the concept of "take" is not a concept suited in toki pona. As mentioned in <a href="#jo">jo,</a> there is a concept of shared possesion that lanpan breaks somewhat. Some people like this though, because it allows you to express something that is normally outside of the boundaries of the language. Personally, I don't hold a very strong opinion either way; I just use it because it is a word that many people understand.
		<br/><li>Some people like to use "kama jo" as a substitute for lanpan, though this kind of misses out on the meaning, as "lanpan" deliberately expresses intent to steal, whereas "kama jo" is more passive.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="lape">lape</a></h3>
		<i><fl>If two people go to sleep, it's considered bilapeial.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: sleeping, resting
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "slapen," meaning "sleep."
		<br/>Example: tenpo ni la mi weka tan <b>lape</b>. (Now, I'm leaving because of <b>sleep</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>Most of the time, lape means sleep, and the resting definition is ignored. However, when it is used to mean rest, it can often cause confusion, because people may think that you are going to sleep even when you are just sitting down for a bit. To remedy this, some people (and when I say some people I mean jan Kawa) made the joke word "slape," which means just sleep. Clearly, this is the worst word ever made in toki pona.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="laso">laso</a></h3>
		<i><fl>In Welsh, "glas" can also mean "inexperienced."</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: blue, green
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Welsh "glas," meaning "blue."
		<br/>Example: ijo ni li <b>laso</b>. kin la, lon ala pi sona pali li open. (This thing is <b>blue</b>. Also, I am starting to run out of examples.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>laso may seem odd if you come from a language which has different words for blue and green, but it actually makes a lot of sense for other languages. Most people tend to think of laso as cyan, or teal, rather than as one or the other.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>The need for a differentiator between green and blue in toki pona has led to two joke word being made: "blaso," which means blue, and "graso," which means green. More serious attempts at differentiation include "laso telo" and "laso kasi" for blue and green respectively.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="lawa">lawa</a></h3>
		<i><fl>lawa suli moment.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: head, mind; to control, direct, guide, lead, own, plan, regulate, rule
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Serbo-Croatian "глава," or "glava," meaning "head."
		<br/>Example: mi <b>lawa</b> e tomo mi. (I <b>own</b> my house.)
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="leko">leko</a></h3>
		<i><fl>musi Manka li musi leko.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: stairs, square, block
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From English "lego."
		<br/>Example: mi pana e <b>leko</b> tawa sina. (I give you a <b>block</b>.)
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="len">len</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Exclusively used in the phrase "len noka."</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: cloth, clothing, fabric, textile; cover, layer of privacy
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Acadian French "linge," meaning "clothing."
		<br/>Example: jan mute li kepeken e <b>len</b> tan ni: ona li wile <b>len</b> e sijelo ona. (People use <b>clothes</b> because of this: They want to <b>cover</b> their bodies.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>One of len's definitions is "cover," which can also mean "cloaked." In this way, its definition kind of overlaps with kon.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="lete">lete</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Raw power.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: cold, cool; uncooked, raw
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Acadian French "frette," meaning "cold."
		<br/>Example: tomo mi li <b>lete</b> mute a tan seme? (Why is my room so very <b>cold</b>?)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>lete is sometimes jokingly used to mean the word "cool," as in, "sina lete" means "You're cool."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="li">li</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Arguably the most important word.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: (between any subject and its verb, and introduces a new verb for the same subject)
		<br/>Part of Speech: particle
		<br/>Etymology: From Esperanto "li," meaning "he."
		<br/>Example: ona <b>li</b> sona li awen pana e ijo. (She knows, and continues to give the thing.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>li is used between the subject and the verb, and it's used in pretty much every single toki pona sentence, so don't forget to put it in! The only time where a li may not be used is when the subject is mi or sina. In this case, you can omit the li, like in "sina pona," which means "you are good." In that case, the li is implied.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>While li is omitted when mi or sina is the subject the vast, <i>vast</i> majority of the time, it's technically not gramatically incorrect to say "mi li" or "sina li," though I would heavily advise against saying this because you will definitely get some weird looks if you say that.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="lili">lili</a></h3>
		<i><fl>A little less important.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: little, small, short; few; a bit; young
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "liklik," meaning "small."
		<br/>Example: mi pilin lape <b>lili</b> tan lon mi pi supa lape. (I'm feeling a <b>little</b> tired, because I'm on my bed.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>lili can either mean few or small. The only way to figure out is by context; if you are talking about a group of things, it's more likely "few," but when talking about a single thing, it's more likely to be "small." However, the context is very important.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>lili famously has two antonyms; "suli," which means "big," and "mute," which means "many." toki pona has a few of these imbalances, where 1 word has two opposites; sewi is a good example.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="linja">linja</a></h3>
		<i><fl>My favorite toki pona word. :></fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: long and flexible thing; cord, hair, rope, thread, yarn
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "linja," meaning "line."
		<br/>Example: ona li tawa lon <b>linja</b> tawa kasi suli. (She walked in a straight <b>line</b> to the tree.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>linja can also be used to mean "connection," since if two things are connected, you could metaphorically "draw a line" between them. In this way, linja is often used to talk about the internet, as in the phrase "linja mi li pakala," which means "My internet cut out." Alternatively, you can use the post-pu word linluwi for connection.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="lipu">lipu</a></h3>
		<i><fl>You're looking at one of these right now!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: flat object; book, document, card, paper, record, website
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "lippu," meaning "flag," or "banner."
		<br/>Example: mi pali e <b>lipu</b> pi jan sin pi toki pona. (I made a <b>website</b> for new people of toki pona.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>lipu in usually means any object that you can write on, but it can really include <i>any</i> object that has a flat surface. Most things that people consider as supa can also be a lipu, like, for example, a table.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="loje">loje</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Bonus musi: either lojelo or jeloje can be orange.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: red, reddish
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "rooie," meaning "red."
		<br/>Example: <b>loje</b> li kule pi pona mute tawa mi. (<b>Red</b> is a really good color, to me.)
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="lon">lon</a></h3>
		<i><fl>The only word you ever need.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: located at, present at, real, true, existing
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preposition
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "long," meaning "at," or "on."
		<br/>Example: tenpo mute la mi <b>lon</b> supa lape mi. (Most of the time, I am <b>on</b> my bed.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>lon is a preposition, which means that you can use it for indirect objects. For a better description of what a preposition is, see <a href="#kepeken">kepeken</a>.
		<br/><li>If something is being described as "lon," it means that it exists. For example, "ijo lon li lon" means "A thing that exists is existing." You can also use "lon e ijo" to mean "bring into existence," like in the sentence, "mi lon e ijo ni," which means "I create this thing."
		<br/><li>One of the definitions of lon is "true," so often, people use lon as an affirmative response, like how you would use "true" in English. However, it may certainly not be used to say "yes" to a question of the form "x ala x."
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>"seme li lon" is a common greeting in toki pona, and it usually means something like "What's up?" in English.

		<br/>

		<br/>Example: mi ken ala <b>lukin</b> e sina tan ni: oko mi li pini. (I can't <b>see</b> you because my eyes are closed.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>A cool constructing you can do with lukin is "lukin mi la," which means "from what I can see."

		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>ma does <i>not</i> refer to a spot. It refers to an area of land, or an outdoors space, not a particular space in a room or other indoor place.

		<i><fl>One of the few homological words in toki pona.</fl></i>

		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>mani can refer to anything that is used as currency, or, more broadly, anything of agreed value. This is where the definition of "large domesticated animal" comes from.

		<i><fl>a! mi meli.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: woman, female, feminine person; wife
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word

		<br/>Example: ona li jan <b>meli</b> pona. (She is a good <b>woman</b>.)

		<br/>Example: ken la <b>mi</b> ken pali e lipu pi jan sin pi toki pona li pana e ona tawa jan mute. (Maybe, <b>I</b> can make a website for new people of toki pona, and give it to a ton of people.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>mi does not just mean "me." mi can mean "we," "us," or any variation on a first person pronoun. Often, people say "mi mute" to differentiate between singular and plural, but I would advise against this unless absolutely necessary.
		<br/><li>Using mi as an adjective to modify a word often shows possesion, as in, "soweli mi" is "my pet." This also works with <a href="#sina">sina</a> and <a href="#ona">ona</a>.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="mije">mije</a></h3>

		<i><fl>o moku e kala pona. omekapo!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to eat, drink, consume, swallow, ingest
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word

		<br/>Example: mi wile <b>moku</b> e <b>moku</b> ale!! (I want to <b>eat</b> all of the <b>food</b>!)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:

		<i><fl>a, monsutatesu li lon. ona li monsuta e mi!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: fear, monster
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Japanese "モンスタ," or "monsuta," meaning "monster."
		<br/>Example: o tawa ala tawa ma ni tan ni: <b>monsuta</b> li lon. (Don't go there because <b>monsters</b> are about.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>monsuta is the origin of the famous "monsutatesu" concept, which is the idea that the transitive definition of a word can mean the opposite of the intransitive definition of a word. Basically, the example goes as thus: "mi monsuta e ona" can mean "I fear them," as part of the definition. "mi monsuta e ona" can <i>also</i> mean "I apply fear to them," or "I make them fear." Therefore, the sentence can either mean "I fear them" or "They fear me."

		<br/>Etymology: Onomatopoeia
		<br/>Example: ona li toki ala. ona li <b>mu</b> taso. (He's not talking, he's just making <b>animal noises</b>.)

		<br/>Example: <b>mun</b> pi tenpo ni li pona lukin. (The <b>stars</b> right now look very pretty.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>As hinted in the flavor text, a common mistake is to assume that mun can only be used when talking about the moon. In reality, it can be used for any night sky object, like stars, planets, galaxies, and what have you.

		<h3><a id="namako">namako</a></h3>
		<i><fl>mi kama nanpa anpa lon musi majon la mi pilin namako lili.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: embellishment, spice; extra, additional
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Hindi "नमक," or "namak," meaning "salt."
		<br/>Example: mi wile pana e <b>namako</b> tawa kalama ni! (I want to bring some <b>spice</b> to this beat!)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>In pu, namako is used as a synonym for <a href="sin">sin,</a> but most people agree that there is a difference. They are still used similarly, but namako has a slightly different connotation to sin.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>Although it isn't the original meaning, namako is often used to talk about literal spices. A good example is "namako pimeja" to mean "black pepper."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="nanpa">nanpa</a></h3>
		<i><fl>*inhales* ILO NANPA LI ILO PI NASIN NANPA PI TOKI PONA</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: -th (ordinal number); numbers
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preposition
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "namba," meaning "number."
		<br/>Example: mi pali e pali <b>nanpa</b> lon tomo sona. (I'm doing <b>number</b> work at the college.) ona li palisa e sike <b>nanpa</b> tu tu. (They hit the fourth ball.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>nanpa, aside from being used just as the word "number," is a particle which says what order things are in. For example, "mi pini lon nanpa tu" means "I finished second."
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>There is an analysis which treats nanpa as a preposition, and with it you can make a whole bunch of interesting constructions. A common phrase is "nanpa anpa," which is "last place." Other common uses include "nanpa pona" and "nanpa sewi," both of which means first.
		<br/><li>Another idea using nanpa is that nanpa can mean "order." For example, "mi nanpa e ona" might mean "I order them." You may even extrapolate this further to mean things like "put into a system."

		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "nasau," meaning "stupid."
		<br/>Example: o kepeken ala e nimi <b>nasa</b>. (Don't use <b>strange</b> words.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>A common mistake is to assume that nasa is bad. In reality, nasa has a mostly neutral connotation. If you want to specify that the thing you're talking about is bad, try "nasa ike."
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>A common use of the word nasa is in the phrase "telo nasa," which means "alcohol."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="nasin">nasin</a></h3>
		<i><fl>divine path = nasin sewi = floating highway</fl></i>

		<br/>Part of Speech: content word

		<h3><a id="ni">ni</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Absolutely Serious musi</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: this, that
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Cantonese "呢," or "ni," meaning "this."
		<br/>Example: sina wile e kili <b>ni</b>, anu kili ante? (Do you want <b>this</b> fruit, or a different one?)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>A common construction in toki pona is called the "ni" method: You can use ni with a colon to make more complex sentences. for example, you could say "mi wile e pona pi jan ale," but that may be confusing, so instead you might say "mi wile e ni: jan ale o pona." This is even more useful in more complex sentences.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>ni is often used in the phrase "tenpo ni," which means "right now."
		<br/><li>Another common construction is the phrase "ni la," which translates approximately to "with this in mind."
		<br/><li>An interesting idea is the idea of using ni as a verb to refer back to something previously said. For example, if we were talking about trees, I might say "mi wile pakala e kasi," but you, as a vigilant tree-lover, might say "o ni ala."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="nimi">nimi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>NIMI SIN!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: name, word
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "nimi," meaning "name."
		<br/>Example: <b>nimi</b> mi li kule epiku Atawan! (My <b>name</b> is Atawan!)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>There are a couple of constructions that you can make with nimi. A few examples are "linja nimi" for "sentence," and "nimi lili" for "letter." Translating the names of the parts of speech is left as an exercise for the reader.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="noka">noka</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Bonuses for the nimi nanpa.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: foot, leg, organ of locomotion; bottom, lower part
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, positional noun
		<br/>Etymology: From Serbo-Croatian "noga" or "нога," meaning "foot."
		<br/>Example: tan seme la <b>noka</b> mi li pilin pakala? (Why does my <b>leg</b> hurt?)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>noka can, in some circumstances, be used to mean -5 (as in, the opposite of <a href="luka">luka</a>). While this is mostly a joke, there are some legitimate applications of this meaning.
		<br/><li>noka can be used as a verb. "mi noka e jan." means "I apply my foot to them," or just "I kick them."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="o">o</a></h3>
		<i><fl>o boy.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: hey! O! (vocative, imperative, or optative)
		<br/>Part of Speech: particle
		<br/>Etymology: From Georgian "-ო" or "-o," the vocative suffix.
		<br/>Example: <b>o</b> pali e ijo pi wile sina. (Do whatever you want to.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>o is another highly complex word. It has 3 primary usages: vocative, imperative, and optative. Vocative is the simplest one: Basically, if you say someone's name followed by o, it means that you are calling them. For example, if someone said "jan Tenli o!" it means they are trying to get the attention of Tenli. They might also say "jan ale o!" to get everyone's attention.
		<br/><li>Imperative is a bit more tricky. Basically, you can drop the word "sina" at the start of a sentence and replace it with the word "o" to turn it into a command. "sina pali." is just a sentence that means "you work," but "o pali" is a command that is <i>telling</i> you to work.
		<br/><li>Lastly, optative is when someone expresses their wishes or desires. This version of o replaces li. As an example, you could say "mi lape." to mean "I sleep," but you might say "mi o lape." to mean "I wish to go to sleep." In this way, it functions similarly to the imperative, but instead you aren't demanding something, just wishing for it.

		<h3><a id="oko">oko</a></h3>
		<i><fl>o moku ala e oko sina. This is just general advice.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: eye, ocular, visual
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Serbo-Croatian "оko" or "око," meaning "eye."
		<br/>Example: waso li <b>oko</b> e mi. (The bird is <b>eyeing</b> me.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>In lipu pu, oko has the exact same meaning as lukin, an it can indeed be used as a synonym. However, oko is usually used specifically to mean eyeball rather than sight in general.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="olin">olin</a></h3>
		<i><fl>o olin e jan ale!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: love, have compassion for, respect, show affection to
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preverb (unconventional)
		<br/>Etymology: From Serbo-Croatian "volim" or "волим," meaning "I love."
		<br/>Example: pilin mi la mi <b>olin</b> e sina. (I think I <b>love</b> you.)
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ona">ona</a></h3>
		<i><fl>ona li monsuta e jan.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: he, she, it, they
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Serbo-Croatian "ona" or "она," meaning "she."
		<br/>Example: mi jo e palisa lili. mi kepeken <b>ona</b> la mi ken pali e ijo. (I have a small stick. If I use <b>it</b>, I can make something.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>English has a lot of specificity compared to toki pona, so it can be difficult to get used to being so vague. ona does not distinguish between gender, animacy, (living/nonliving) number, or really anything else. This can greatly affect they way you talk about things in toki pona.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="open">open</a></h3>
		<i><fl>The only english cognate.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: begin, start; open; turn on

		<h3><a id="pakala">pakala</a></h3>
		<i><fl>lawa.exe li pakala.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: botched, broken, damaged, harmed, messed up

		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "bagarap," meaning "accident," from English "bugger up."
		<br/>Example: ike la mi <b>pakala</b> e suno lili. (Oops, I accidentaly <b>broke</b> the light.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>pakala is often used as an interjection, specifically as a curse expletive, or swear word.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="pake">pake</a></h3>
		<i><fl>o pake e nasa sina!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: stop, cease
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preverb
		<br/>Etymology: From Acadian French "barrer," meaning "to lock."
		<br/>Example: sinpin li <b>pake</b> e jan lete pi tawa anpa. (The wall <b>blocked</b> the downhill skier.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>This word's definition has some overlap with <a href="pini">pini</a> because, in lipu pu, pake was removed, and instead pini's definition was extended to cover over it. pini and pake still have distinct definitions to this day, although some people don't recognize it.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="pali">pali</a></h3>
		<i><fl>pali li ike...</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: do, take action on, work on; build, make, prepare
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word, preverb (unconventional)
		<br/>Etymology: From Esperanto "fari," meaning "do," from Italian "fare."
		<br/>Example: o <b>pali</b> e ijo pi wile sina. (<b>Make</b> something you want to make.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>pali has a rather unconventional preverb definition; it can act as a sort of transitivity marker. As an example, "mi uta e ona" may mean "I taste it," but "mi pali uta e ona" means "I make it into a mouth."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="palisa">palisa</a></h3>
		<i><fl>"have I been muted this whole time? oh that's neat."</fl></i>

		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: give, send, emit, provide, put, release
		<br/>Part of Speech: content word
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "panna," meaning "put."
		<br/>Example: sina ken ala ken <b>pana</b> e wile sina tawa mi? (Can you <b>give</b> me what you want?)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>There are lots of compound words which use pana. "pana sona" may mean "teach," "pana wawa" may mean "throw," and "pana mi" may mean "what I give."
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>pana is often used more poetically, as it can replace lots of other words. For example, "mi toki e ijo ni tawa sina" can be expressed with more words as "mi pana e toki pi ijo ni tawa sina." This may or may not be more helpful, depending on the context.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="pi">pi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>PI SINA</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: (used to regroup modifiers)
		<br/>Part of Speech: particle
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "bilong," meaning "of," from English "belong."
		<br/>Example: mi moku e kili <b>pi</b> suwi mute. (I'm eating a very sweet fruit.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>pi is used to divide the order and way that noun groups affect the main noun. Using the example, "kili suwi mute" means "many sweet fruits," but "kili <i>pi</i> suwi mute" means "very sweet fruits." Another good example is "ilo kalama musi," which means "fun and noisy tool" versus "ilo <i>pi</i> kalama musi," which means "music tool."
		<br/><li>A common mistake is equating pi to the word "of". This can be helpful, but it can also be somewhat misleading. pi only regroups modifiers, so in many cases it is not like "of."
		<br/><li>If you need more examples of how to use pi, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/301378960468738050/780287029044707338/unknown.png">here</a> is a good example by asali.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>Similarly to the way that you should omit a <a href="#li">li</a> when it comes after mi or sina, you shouldn't use a pi it there is only one word after it. If you have a single word after a pi, it means the exact same thing as if you didn't have the pi at all. There are very specific cases where a single word after a pi might add clarification, but be warned: you might get looks if you do it.

		<br/>Definition: heart (physical or emotional); feeling (an emotion, a direct experience)

		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "pilim," meaning "feel."
		<br/>Example: mi wile <b>pilin</b> e kala waso lete! (I would like to <b>feel</b> the penguin!)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>pilin is uniquely copular, so be sure not to confuse "mi pilin pona" with "mi pilin <i>e</i> pona." The first one means "I'm good" while the second one means "I'm touching a good."
		<br/><li>similarly to all of the positional words, pilin can also mean "heart." A very common mistake is to assume that <a href="#olin">olin</a> means heart, but this is not the case.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>A very common saying in toki pona is "sina pilin seme?" which means "how are you?" A good response would be "mi pilin pona!" or "mi pilin ike."

In general, sama can be used as an adjective to show anything that is similar to something else. As an example, "soweli pi sama telo" means "animal that is like water," which may be interpreted as "cat."

Alternatively, if you don't want to be so nasa, you can say "mi pali e ni tan wile ona," or "mi pali e ni tan ni: ona li wile e ona."

		<h3><a id="taso">taso</a></h3>

		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: but, however; only
		<br/>Part of Speech: modifier particle, conjunction, content word (unconventional)
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "tasol," meaning "only."
		<br/>Example: mi wile e sitelen <b>taso</b>. (I <b>only</b> want a picture.) ona li pona, <b>taso</b> ona li nasa lili. (It's good, <i>but</i> it's also a little strange.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>It is sometimes considered a rule that taso can only mean "however" if it is at the beginning of a sentence, but it is not very heavily enforced, so it is up to you if you want to follow it.
		<br/><li>You can change the position of taso to specify the thing you are referring to. For example, "sina pali e ni taso" means "You only made <i>this</i>," implying that you may have done other things with it, whereas "sina pali taso e ni" means "You only <i>made</i> this," implying that you may have made other things. It is complicated to explain in English, but gets easier with practice.

		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>It is very important to distinguish the propositional and content word uses of tawa especially, since they often go right next to eachother. For example, "mi pana e sike tawa tawa sina" can be difficult to parse, but it means "I throw a moving ball to you."
		<br/><li>tawa can also mean "from the perspective of." An example would be "ona li lon tawa mi," which means "It exists to me," or, more clearly, "To me, it exists."
