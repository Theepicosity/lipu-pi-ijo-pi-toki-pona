		<h1>Beginner's Resource of Toki Pona</h1>
		<h2><i>tan kule epiku Atawan</i></h2>
		<br/>
		toki! My name is kule epiku Atawan, and this is my resource for Toki Pona! Despite the name, this resource is meant to help people on any scale of toki pona. If you are a beginner who wants to learn the words, or an experienced speaker who may have just forgetten a defenition, this document can help!
		<br/><br/>
		Below is a list of words commonly used in toki pona, it's definition, some examples, it's glyph, (sitelen pona) and some other cool facts about the word. Please note that various sources list different words. Some of these words are <i>non-pu,</i> meaning that they don't show up in the book written by the creator of the language, Sonja Lang. This may be because it comes before the book and it was removed, or it comes after the book and was made by the toki pona community. This one shows a couple more than pu- basically, all of the common ones that you may want to use. There are more obscure words which don't come up as often; if you encounter a word that you haven't seen before, it may be in either <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10hP3kR7mFN0E6xW3U6fZyDf7xKEEvxssM96qLq4E0ms/edit">nimi ale pona</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1odOeRhe7-I2g25OmeyazW5uAD56m5Po7">nimi ale</a>.
		<br/><br/>
		If you are looking for a course for learning toki pona, this is not the place. Instead, for courses I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuYLhuXt4HrQIv3xnDxZqRaLfmxB2U5rJ">12 Days of Toki Pona by jan Misali,</a> as it's the one I learned from. Other people also say that <a href="https://rnd.neocities.org/tokipona/">this course by /dev/urandom</a> is pretty good.

		<h3><a id="a">a</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Everything else is just as complex.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: (emphasis, emotion or confirmation)
		<br/>Etymology: From onomatopoeia.
		<br/>Example: ni li suli mute <b>a</b>! (This is very, <b>very</b> big!)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>a doesn't really mean anything precise. It simply adds emphasis to your conversation, like a cherry on top of your word sundae. For example, "ona li ike a" still means "It is bad," but it's <i>particularly</i> bad. The "a" in this sentence conveys more emotion than simply saying "ona li ike." In this way, "a" sortof acts like an exclaimation point.
		<br/><li>A common response to, well, anything in toki pona is simply responding with "a." It can be used to show your acknowledgement of something.
		<br/><li>Keep in mind that a is still a modifier, and only a modifier. You can't say "ni li a," atleast without being very confusing. "a" doesn't really mean anything on its own.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="akesi">akesi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>The golden idol of toki pona.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: non-cute animal; reptile, amphibian
		<br/>Etymology: From the Dutch "hagedis," meaning "lizard."
		<br/>Example: <b>akesi</b> suli li lon tenpo pini. (Big <b>reptiles</b> were present in the past.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>Note that, although akesi can mean both a non-cute animal <i>and</i> a lizard, it doens't imply that those are the same. You can have an "akesi suwi" (cute lizard) as much as an other animal.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ala">ala</a></h3>
		<i><fl>[This flavor text left intentionally blank.]</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: no, not, zero
		<br/>Etymology: From the Georgian "არა," or "ara," meaning "no."
		<br/>Examples: mi sona <b>ala</b> e nasin pi toki ni. (I <b>don't</b> know how to speak this language.) sina sona <b>ala</b> sona? (Do you know?)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>Aside from simply adding a negator to any word it modifies, ala is also how questions are commly formed in toki pona. Putting "x ala x" is pretty much just asking "x, or not x?" For example, "sina pona ala pona?" does mean "Are you good?" but it more literally means "Are you good or not good?"
		<br/><li>Be careful when using ala. A common mistake for beginners is to say "mi sona e toki pona ala," but unless you are trying to say "I know not toki pona," then you should say "mi sona ala e toki pona." In the second sentence, the "ala" modifies the verb, changing it to "don't know," while in the first, the "ala" modifies the noun, changing it to "not toki pona."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="alasa">alasa</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Reminder that toki pona is based from hunter-gatherer values.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to hunt, forage
		<br/>Etymology: From the Acadian French "à la chasse," meaning "hunting," from the French "chasser," which means "to hunt."
		<br/>Example: jan ante li <b>alasa</b> e kili lili. (Other people <b>forage</b> for the small fruit.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>In casual conversation, alasa is used simply for "find." For example, "mi wile alasa e supa monsi ante" means "I want to find another chair."
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>Some people use alasa as a preverb, that is, a word that comes before a verb to change it's meaning. Preverb alasa means "try," as in, "mi alasa sona e sina," meaning "I try to understand you." This is opposed to the other word which means try, "lukin." Another fun idea is that alasa can mean actions with no definite end, whereas lukin refer to actions which can end.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ale">ale</a></h3>
		<i><fl>ale li pona.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: all; abundant, countless, bountiful, every, plentiful; abundance, everything, life, universe; one hundred
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "alle," meaning "all."
		<br/>Example: jan <b>ale</b> li ike. taso mi ike ala. (Everyone is <b>bad</b> except for me.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>When talking about numbers in toki pona, ale can mean 100. For example, "ale mute mute luka tu wan" means 100+20+20+5+2+1, or 148.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="anpa">anpa</a></h3>
		<i><fl>The univeral word for "land above."</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: bowing down, downward, humble, lowly, dependent
		<br/>Etymology: From Acadian French "en bas," meaning "below."
		<br/>Example: mi kepeken e nasin <b>anpa</b>. (I take the <b>downward</b> road.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>anpa is a relative positional noun, meaning that it refers to a position relative to the subject. For example, "ona li lona anpa pi supa lape" means "It is underneath my bed." This is one of the weaker examples of a positional noun though, as it means a lot more than just "downwards."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ante">ante</a></h3>
		<i><fl>And kule ante is magenta.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: different, altered changed, other
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "ander," meaning "other," or "different."
		<br/>Example: ona li <b>ante</b> e nasin pi musi ni. (They <b>changed</b> the rules of the game.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>When using this word, take into consideration that it does not mean "opposite." It only means different, so a "pimeja ante" doesn't mean white, it only means a different shade of black.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>ante can be used in many phrases. Some cool examples include: "jan ante" which means "other people," and "toki ante" which means "different speech." Putting this phrase into the verb spot gives us the word "translate."
		<br/><li>Another neat phrase is "ante la," which means "differently." This is often used to change the topic of a conversation, as in "mi sona e ni. ante la, sina sona ala sona e musi Tewawija?" which means "I know this. Changing the subject, do you know the game Terraria?"
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="anu">anu</a></h3>
		<i><fl>sina anu anu anun't e nimi?</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: or
		<br/>Etymology: From Georgian "ან," or "an," meaning "or."
		<br/>Example: sina ken pali <b>anu</b> musi; seme li pona tawa sina? (You can work <b>or</b> play; which one do you think is good?)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>A common phrase in toki pona is "anu seme," which means "or what." It's often stapled onto the end of sentences to turn them into questions, for example, "sina ken toki, anu seme?" means "Can you talk?" but it more literally means "Can you talk, or what?" This isn't to say that it has the same laid-back English connontation... but it is used in the same way.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>anu is rarely used as a content word, meaning to choose, or decide. For example, "o anu e leko" is telling someone to decide on a block.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="awen">awen</a></h3>
		<i><fl>o awen pona, lon weka sina.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: enduring, kept, protected, safe, waiting, staying; to continue to
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "houden," meaning "keep, care for, hold. (in a particular state)"
		<br/>Examples: ona li moli ala la ona li <b>awen</b>. (If it's not dead, it <b>continues</b>.) taso, pilin mi la ona li <b>awen</b> pakala. (However, I think it will <b>continue</b> to break.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>awen can be used as a preverb, meaning that it can go before the verb to modify it. An example of this would be "ona li awen pona," which means "It continues to be good."
		<br/><li>A common thing to say in toki pona before the beginning of a sentence is "awen la," which means "continually." An example would be "awen la ona li pipi e mi," which means "She continually anoys me." The distinction between "awen la" and awen preverb is subtle, but noticeable.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="e">e</a></h3>
		<i><fl>It's the one particle everyone seems to forget.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: (before the direct object)
		<br/>Etymology: Unknown
		<br/>Example: mi pana <b>e</b> telo tawa sina. (I give water to you.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>Always remember to use e. A common beginners mistake is to omit e, like in the sentence "mi kama sona e toki pona," which is sometimes incorrectly said as "mi kama sona toki pona." It does sound more similar to English, but remember that it's not correct.
		<br/><li>e goes before the direct object, so it's the thing your doing the action on. This causes some quirks that you must be aware of; for example, "mi toki e sina" doesn't mean I'm talking to you, but it means "I talk about you."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="en">en</a></h3>
		<i><fl>And another particle which just straight up isn't used.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: (between multiple subjects)
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "en," meaning "and."
		<br/>Example: jan Jepo <b>en</b> jan Tenli li pali e lipu sin. (Jepo <b>and</b> Tenli are making a new book.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>A common English word that en is compared to is "and," which can be useful as a demonstration but isn't really how en works. English "and" is much more versatile than en is; for example, in English you can say "I ignored and blocked her," but you cannot say "mi weka en pake e ona." Instead, you would say "mi weka li pake e ona." en can only be used to connect subjects; other words connect verbs and objects, specifically li and e respectively.
		<br/><li>Multiple subjects with the word en are considered "connected," in that they share the same verb. An example of this is "mi en sina li pana e leko tu." This sentence means "Me and you give two blocks," but not two blocks <i>each</i>.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>en is sometimes used in the phrase "en la" to mean "and." This definitely isn't how you're supposed to use it, because en isn't a content word and thus has no meaning, but it's still fun.
		<br/><li>en is also sometimes used to like items in prepositional phrases together. For example, "mi pana e ni tawa jan Jepo en jan Tenli." In this case, I am giving something to both Jepo and Tenli.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="esun">esun</a></h3>
		<i><fl>In my opinion, this is one of the weeker words.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: market, shop, fair, bazaar, business transaction
		<br/>Etymology: Of Akan origin.
		<br/>Example: mi tawa <b>esun</b>. (I go to the <b>store</b>.)
		<br/></ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>One of the most common uses of esun (probably more common than what it's actually used for) is the phrase "tenpo esun," meaning "week." This is because most business operations are week-based, and so one could say that a unit of "business time" is a week. Yes, I know, it's a tenuous claim.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ijo">ijo</a></h3>
		<i><fl>It's most common usage is in example sentences.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: thing, phenomenon, object, matter
		<br/>Etymology: From Esperanto "io," meaning "something," which is from Romance "i-," which is the root of relative pronouns.
		<br/>Example: <b>ijo</b> ni li kama sewi. (This <b>thing</b> is rising.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>ijo may sometimes be used to mean "situation." "ijo ni li ike" may mean "This is a bad situation."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ike">ike</a></h3>
		<i><fl>ike pike sike sike.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: bad, negative; non-essential, irrelevant
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "ilkeä," meaning "mean," or "wicked."
		<br/>Example: sina pakala e supa sike? ni li <b>ike</b> a! (You broke your table? That's <b>terrible</b>!)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>There are plenty of words in toki pona (arguably, all of them) which can be used as interjections, single word sentences. ike is one of the most common examples of this; if someone told you that they had to do schoolwork all day and haven't had a break, an appropriate response would be "ike!"
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ilo">ilo</a></h3>
		<i><fl>ilo nanpa li ken <s>ilo</s>weka e nanpa!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: tool, implement, machine, device
		<br/>Etymology: From Esperanto "ilo," meaning "tool."
		<br/>Example: mi pali e tomo kepeken <b>ilo</b>. (I made a house with a <b>tool</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>The transitive verb from of ilo is "to make into a tool," which has the same meaning as the word kepeken. So, at least in the verb case, you could say that kepeken and ilo are synonyms.
		<br/><li>The phrase "tenpo ilo," which may or may not also be used more than the actual meaning of the word, is generally interpreted to mean either "minutes" or "hours," the idea being that minutes and hours can be used as a tool for telling the time.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="insa">insa</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Whenever a word sounds kinda like English, assume it has Tok Pisin etymology.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: centre, content, inside, between; internal organ, stomach
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "insait," meaning "inside."
		<br/>Example: moku ni li pakala e <b>insa</b> mi. (This food hurts my <b>stomach</b>.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>insa is a relative positional noun, so you can use it to describe positions relative to you. For example, "ona li lon insa pi supa lape" is "It is inside my bed." All positional nouns follow this pattern; each one can mean a position, aswell as a part of the body, in this case, the stomach.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="jaki">jaki</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Not an accurate description of yakisoba.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: disgusting, obscene, sickly, toxic, unclean, unsanitary
		<br/>Etymology: From English "yucky."
		<br/>Example: tomo ni li <b>jaki</b>. (This house is <b>gross</b>.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>You can also say "jaki ala" to mean clean. This is most commonly used as a verb: "mi jaki ala e sijelo mi" means "I clean my body."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="jan">jan</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Cut out the middlejan.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: human being, person, somebody
		<br/>Etymology: From Cantonese "人," or "jan," meaning "person."
		<br/>Example: <b>jan</b> ale li sona e ma ni. (Every <b>person</b> knows about this place.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>When saying names in toki pona, it's important that the name has to describe something. The most common thing for it to describe is a jan, because most people tend to be humans. For this reason, the word "jan" may be shortened to just the letter "j" when talking about someones name. For example, "jan Tenli" may be shortened to "jTenli."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="jasima">jasima</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Usually pronounced "jasima." <jasima1>"jasima."</jasima1> <jasima2>"jasima."</jasima2> <jasima3>"jasima."</jasima3> <jasima4>"kulijo!"</jasima4></fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: reflect, resound, mirror, be on the opposite/polar end of
		<br/>Etymology: From Turkish "yansıtmak," meaning "to reflect," or "to reverberate."
		<br/>Example: tenpo mi li tenpo <b>jasima</b> sina. (My time is the <b>opposite</b> of your time.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>jasima is a post-pu word- one of the most common, in fact. It was of a few created by a commitee of people on the <i>ma pona pi toki pona</i> Discord server.
		<br/><li>jasima often means just a few things which aren't quite related to what it actually means. jasima is often used to mean "echo," which is a valid interpretation, but it's also used to mean "livestream," or "record," as in, "sina ken ala ken jasima e sinpin sina?" which means "can you stream your screen?" The idea comes from the fact that the streamed recording is a reflection of the orginal, but it's not quite the same meaning as jasima proper.
		<br/><li>jasima is sometimes used as a preposition, though this usage is not very popular. If you want to see the first word that is <i>actually</i> a preposition, see kepeken.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="jelo">jelo</a></h3>
		<i><fl>palisa jelo li kili nanpa wan!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: yellow, yellowish
		<br/>Etymology: From English "yellow."
		<br/>Example: palisa <b>jelo</b> ni li moku pona. (This <b>yellow</b> stick is good food.)
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="jo">jo</a></h3>
		<i><fl>The opposite of jon't is jo-positive.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to have, carry, contain, hold
		<br/>Etymology: From Mandarin "有," or "yǒu," meaning "have."
		<br/>Example: mi <b>jo</b> e lipu pi sitelen tawa. (I'm <b>carrying</b> a book about movies.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>A common trap that many newer people fall into is interpreting jo as the English word "have." jo is much more limiting than "have;" a better way of thinking of it is to compare it to the word "carry." The sentence "mi jo e soweli" does not mean "I have a cat," it literally means "I am carrying a cat."
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>There is a faction of people known as <i>jon'ters</i> who insist that jo is an uneccessary word. The argument here is that jo can be replaced by other words, specifically either poki or luka. So, while a sane person would say, "mi jo e supa monsi ni" to mean "I am carrying this chair," a jon'ter would say, "mi luka e supa monsi ni," meaning "This chair is in my hand."
		<br/><li>A common usage of the word jo is "metaphorical jo," which is when you use the word jo with something that isn't really an object. An example of this is "lawa mi li jo e sona lili," which means "My brain carries little information."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kala">kala</a></h3>
		<i><fl>jan mute li kala! penguins li kala.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: fish, marine animal, sea creature
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "kala," meaning "fish."
		<br/>Example: mi wile lanpan e seli tan <b>kala</b> sewi. (I must steal fire from the <b>fish</b> gods.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>kala can mean any sort of animal that goes into water. This includes obvious ones, like fish, to whales and dolphins, but any water animal can be a kala. Penguins are sometimes called kala because they spend lots of time in water.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kalama">kalama</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kalama seli li SKHKSHKSHKSKH</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to produce a sound; recite, utter aloud
		<br/>Etymology: From Serbo-Croatian "galama," meaning "fuss," or "noise."
		<br/>Example: <b>kalama</b> mute li lon. (There's lots of <b>noise</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>A common usage of kalama is the phrase "kalama musi." kalama doesn't mean music though; it means any sound. Because it is a general sound, it has a lot of overlap with other words. toki is just "kalama jan," and mu is just "kalama soweli."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kama">kama</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kala (li) kama kamalawala ala la kala (li) kama lawa tawa ma kala (li) ken kalama tawa kala lawa.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: arriving, coming, future, summoned; to become, manage to, succeed in
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "kamap," meaning "arrive," or "happen."
		<br/>Examples: <b>kama</b> pi jan suli li suli tawa kulupu ni. (The <b>arrival</b> of the ambassador is important to this town.) mi <b>kama</b> pali e ni (I <b>manage</b> to do this.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>The main usage of kama is as a preverb. Despite being the primry definition, it doesn't translate well into English; you can think of it as "coming," as in, "mi kama lape" means "I am coming to sleep," but even that doesn't portray the word very well.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kapesi">kapesi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>ona li moli kapesi.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: brown, gray
		<br/>Etymology: From Greek "καφές," or "kafés," meaning "light brown."
		<br/>Example: sike ni li <b>kapesi</b>. (This circle is <b>brown</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>kapesi is a pre-pu word, and probably the least used one on this list. Color words are typically considered irrelevant anyways, so if you don't want to use non-pu words, you can say "kule ma" to mean earth color.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kasi">kasi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kasi ike mute li lon mi ni! kasi ike li lon!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: plant, vegetation; herb, leaf
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "kasvi," meaning "plant."
		<br/>Example: mi sona ala e <b>kasi</b> pi loje laso. (I don't know of a purple <b>plant</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>The definition of most things in toki pona is not strictly scientific, and this word is a good example. "kasi" can refer to plants, but can also refer to things that aren't typically considered plants, like lichen or algae or coral.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ken">ken</a></h3>
		<i><fl>In the context of possibility...</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to be able to, be allowed to, can, may; possible
		<br/>Etymology: From Tok Pisin "ken," meaning "can."
		<br/>Examples: sina <b>ken</b> pali e kalama musi sin. (You <b>could</b> make a new song.) <b>ken</b> pi kama mi li lili. (The <b>possibility</b> of my arrival is slim.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>ken as a preverb means that something is possible, but this can mean much more than the English word "can." It could mean "can," or it could mean "may," or "able to." One thing that it may not mean, though, is "must." ken generally leans towards things that have a <i>possibility</i> of being done, but don't have to. If you want a word that implies things <i>need</i> to be done, see wile.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>The interpretation that the noun form of ken is possibility is very rarely used, though it does appear in the most common phrase using ken, "ken la," which means "in the context of possibility," or put more simply, "maybe." Some people don't like this interpretation though, and insist that "ken la" isn't a good translation of "maybe."

		<h3><a id="kepeken">kepeken</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Either the prettiest word or the ugliest word, but either way we can all agree that it's too long.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: to use, with, by means of
		<br/>Etymology: From Dutch "gebruiken," meaning "to use."
		<br/>Examples: ona li pali e lupa suli <b>kepeken</b> luka ona taso. (He made a giant hole <b>using</b> only his hands.) mi wile <b>kepeken</b> e ilo ni. (I need to <b>use</b> this tool.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>kepeken is a preposition. (The first one on this list!) This means that you can use it after the direct object to specify an indirect object. For example, if you wanted to say "I make a house with a hammer," you could say "mi pali e tomo," but the hammer would disappear! To solve this problem, you can use a preposition to specify the inderect object, so in this case you could say "mi pali e tomo <i>kepeken</i> ilo."
		<br/><li>Be careful when using prepositions. There is not particle to determine where a prepositional phrase starts, so you must pay attention and use the context of the sentence to find it.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>Usually, when you use prepositions without a direct object you omit the word "e," because if you include it, the meaning of the sentence may change. However, kepeken is an interesting case. "mi kepeken e ni" has effectively the same meaning as "mi kepeken ni," except for the fact that some people hate it. Use whichever interpretation you want.

		<h3><a id="kili">kili</a></h3>
		<i><fl>kili lili li lili kili</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: fruit, vegetable, mushroom
		<br/>Etymology: From Georgian "ხილი," or "xili," meaning "fruit."
		<br/>Example: mi li moku e <b>kili</b> loje. (We are eating a red <b>fruit</b>.)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>kili can mean pretty much any edible plant part that isn't pan. Many things can be kili if you can eat them, for example, <i>cacti</i>. In fact, it's not even limited to plants, as muchrooms can be kili too, though some people insist on making a new word for all fungi, called "soko."

		<h3><a id="kin">kin</a></h3>
		<i><fl>Somewhere inbetween "has a meaning" and "doesn't have a meaning."</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: too, also, as well
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "-kin," meaning "too," or "also."
		<br/>Example: sina kute e kalama musi ni? mi kute e ona <b>kin</b>! (You've heard this song? I've heard it <b>too</b>!)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>In pu, "kin" is treated as a complete synonym of a, but in modern usage this isnt really true. kin still means emphasis, just a specific type that says "me too!" Some circles of toki pona may continue to use kin in the same way as a, so be aware of this when using this word.
		</ul>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>A cool phrase to use is "kin la," which means "also." This often relates back to the previous sentence, as in "jan mute li lon. kin la, jan mute li toki ala," which means "Many people are here. Also, many people aren't talking."
		<br/><li>Most of the time, kin is strapped onto the end of a sentence, but sometimes it's used like a regular modifier. You can say "mi pali e ni kin" to mean "I'm doing this too," but if you want to, you can say "mi kin li pali e ni" to mean "I, too, am doing this."

		<h3><a id="kipisi">kipisi</a></h3>
		<i><fl>TEN WORDS THEY DON'T TEACH YOU IN PU!!</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: split, cut, slice
		<br/>Etymology: From Iñupiat "kipriruk," meaning "cut," or from Swahili "kipisi," meaning "sliver."
		<br/>Example: ona li <b>kipisi</b> e pan. (He <b>sliced</b> the bread.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>kipisi means a similar, though not quite exact, thing to the word tu. Both can mean "to make into two," but while "mi tu e ijo ni" means "I make this thing into two," "mi kipisi e ijo ni" specifically means "I cut this thing into two parts," which implies that the two things created from the action are <i>parts</i> of the whole.
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kiwen">kiwen</a></h3>
		<i><fl>In some, admittedly dumb, dialects, this means -1.</fl></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>Definition: hard object, metal, rock, stone
		<br/>Etymology: From Finnish "kiven," meaning "stone."
		<br/>Example: mi pana e <b>kiwen</b> tawa telo. (I threw the <b>stone</b> into the water.)
		<br/>Tips and Tricks:
		<br/><ul><li>kiwen as a modifier means "hard," but it can really represent any attribute that a stone has. In some cases, it can mean a similar thing to the word awen, in that it can be used to mean "tough," or "enduring."
		</ul><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="ko">ko</a></h3>
		<i><fl>jan ko's jan's ko's jan ko.</fl></i>

		<br/><br/>
		
		<h3><a id="kon">kon</a></h3>

		<br/>Example: <b>kon</b> pi nimi sin ni li seme? (What's the <b>spirit</b> of this word?)
		<br/>Fun Knowledge:
		<br/><ul><li>kon can mean many things, and is useful as both an adjective and a noun. "kon wawa" is wind, "len kon" is a cloak, "jan kon" is a spy, "kon nimi" is a definition, "monsuta kon" is a ghost, and "kon jan" is a person's soul. Just to name a few.
