here is the list i usually refer to as "new words that are useful to know"
tonsi
jasima
lanpan
isipin
meso
misikeke
leko
monsuta
kipisi
powe
pake
kapesi
majuna
apeja
i think we can all agree that this is a set of words that are fairly common and nice to know and understand, even if you dont use them all.

here is a list of less common, but still quite nice words that you can use if you want:
soko
kese
kiki
ete
kan
ewe
taki
usawi
inuka
soto
teje
tenki
unu
natu
linluwi
waleja
tokana
te/to
misa
these ones arent really necessary to know, but they are sometimes useful, especially in specific contexts where distinguishing these ideas may be helpful.
